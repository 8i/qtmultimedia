This example performs some simple OpenCL operations on camera or video input which
is assumed to be provided in RGB format. The OpenCL operation is done on an
OpenGL texture using CL-GL interop, without any further readbacks or copies
(except for the initial texture upload, when necessary).

Currently only OS X and Windows with desktop OpenGL (opengl32.dll) are supported.
On Windows you may need to edit testplugin.pro to specify the location of the OpenCL
headers and libraries.

Note that an OpenCL implementation with GPU support is required.
The platform and device selection logic supports NVIDIA and Intel.
Porting to other platforms is probably simple, see clCreateContextFromType.
Note however that YUV formats, that are commonly used also for camera input
on some platforms, are not supported in this example.

Pass the name of a video file to perform video playback or launch without
arguments to use the camera.

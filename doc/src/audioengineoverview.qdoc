\title Positional Audio
\brief 3D positional audio playback and content management

\section1 QtAudioEngine features

Qt Multimedia includes the \c QtAudioEngine QML module for
providing 3D positional audio playback and content management.

QtAudioEngine enables developers to organize wave files into discrete \l Sound with different
\l {PlayVariation}{play variations}, group sound controls by \l {AudioCategory} categories and
define \l {AttenuationModelLinear}{attenuation models} and various 3d audio settings all in one
place. Playback of \l {SoundInstance}{sound instances} can be conveniently activated by in-app
events and managed by QtAudioEngine or controlled by explicitly defining a \l SoundInstance elment
for easier qml bindings.

QtAudioEngine elements can be accessed through importing the
\b{QtAudioEngine 1.0} module.

\qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtAudioEngine 1.0

AudioEngine {

}

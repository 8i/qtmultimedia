\title Multimedia Overview
\brief A set of APIs for working with audio, video, radio and camera devices.

\section1 Multimedia Features

Qt Multimedia offers APIs for doing many multimedia related tasks:

\list
\o Accessing raw audio devices for input and output
\o Play low latency sound effects
\o Play media files in playlists (like compressed audio, or video files)
\o Record audio and compress it
\o Tune and listen to radio stations, and receive radio program information
\o Use a camera, including viewfinder, image capture, and movie recording
\endlist

\section1 Multimedia Components

All of these tasks can be broadly broken down into four main areas.  More information
(including background information and class references) are available here:

\section1 Multimedia Limitations

In many cases the Qt Multimedia APIs build upon the multimedia framework of the underlying system.
This can mean that support for various codec or containers can vary between machines,
depending on what the end user has installed.  See \l {Multimedia Platform Support} for more
information on what frameworks are used and what this can mean.

\section1 Advanced Usage

For developers wishing to access some platform specific settings,
or to port the Qt Multimedia APIs to a new platform or technology,
see \l{Multimedia Backend Development}.

\title Multimedia Overview
\brief A set of APIs for working with audio, video, radio and camera devices.

\ingroup technology-apis


\section1 Overview

\section2 Features

Qt Multimedia offers APIs for doing many multimedia related tasks:

\list
\li Accessing raw audio devices for input and output
\li Play low latency sound effects
\li Play media files in playlists (like compressed audio, or video files)
\li Record audio and compress it
\li Tune and listen to radio stations, and receive radio program information
\li Use a camera, including viewfinder, image capture, and movie recording
\li Play 3D positional audio
\li Decode audio media files into memory for processing
\li Accessing video frames or audio buffers as they are played or recorded
\endlist

\section2 Multimedia Components

All of these tasks can be broadly broken down into four main areas.  More information
(including background information and class references) are available here:

\li \l {Video Overview}
\li \l {Camera Overview}
\li \l {Radio Overview}
\endlist

\section1 Limitations

In many cases the Qt Multimedia APIs build upon the multimedia framework of the underlying system.
This can mean that support for various codec or containers can vary between machines,
depending on what the end user has installed.

\section1 Advanced Usage

For developers wishing to access some platform specific settings,
or to port the Qt Multimedia APIs to a new platform or technology,
see \l{Multimedia Backend Development}.

\section1 Changes from previous versions

If you've previously used Qt Multimedia in Qt 4.x, or used Qt Multimedia Kit in Qt Mobility, please see
\l {Changes in Qt Multimedia} for more information on what has changed, and what you might need to
change when porting code.
